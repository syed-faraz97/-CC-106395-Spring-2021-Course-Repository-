Is java an interpretor or compiler ? give 3 refrences 

Many of the other languages are considered as any one between (compiler and an interpreter). But JAVA is little bit
different from all others as it do compilation and interpretation both. It is because to make JAVA independent to the
operating system. The other languages such as C, it converts the code directly to the machine understandable language
(binary) and that makes them OS dependent.

JAVA compiles and interprets both, HOW?

In JAVA there is a Bytecode system. Now what is it? The compiler or the JAVA firstly converts the program code into the
Bytecode to get it executed further by (JVM) JAVA Virtual Machine.
In the above mentioned process the JAVA interpreter plays a vital role and converts the code into operating system
understandable binary code to get it generate further output.
Basic demonstration below,
.java file (writing code) --> compile --> .class file (compiling/bytecode) ---> interpret --> Machine code (Running
code/Output)
The JAVA interpreter that we load, should be compatible to the OS.
